This is an R Markdown document to build a report for LP Brewery telling them all the information from their new problem with Grape and their previous problem before Grape

## Install important library
```{r}
#install.packages("lpSolve")
library(lpSolve)
```

## Save the profit for each soda
```{r}
# profit
obj_coef <- c(13,23,30)
# without Grape
obj_coe2<- c(13,23)
```

## Matrix for CO2, Water, Flavor, and hours for each soda
```{r}
# matrix
con <- matrix(c(
  5,15,10,
  4,4,4,
  35,20,15,
  5,10,20
), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)

# without Grape
con2 <- matrix(c(
  5,15,
  4,4,
  35,20,
  5,10
), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
```

## Directions
```{r}
# directions
dir <- c("<=",
         "<=",
         "<=",
         "<="
         )
```

## Resouces for all soda should be less that 480 for CO2, 160 for water,
1190 for flavor, and in 3 months
```{r}
# resources
res <- c(480,
         160,
         1190,
         500
         )
```

# Claculte the max
```{r}
sol <- lp(
  "max",
  obj_coef,
  con,
  dir,
  res
  )

# without Grape
sol2 <- lp(
  "max",
  obj_coe2,
  con2,
  dir,
  res
)
```

## Value of objective function
```{r}
sol$objval
```
# The total profit in 3 months with Grape it will be 953.6$

## Objective values of Strawberry, Orange, and Grape
```{r}
sol$solution
```
# The amount of each type of soda here we have: 5.6 of Strawberry,
21.6 of Orange, and 12.8 of Grape

## Visualize Amount of each type of soda with Grape
```{r}
barplot(sol$solution,
     main ="Amount of each type of Soda",
     names.arg = c("Strawberry", "Orange", "Grape"),
     col = "blue",
     density = 20
     )
```

## Value of objective function without Grape
```{r}
sol2$objval
```
# The total profit in 3 months without Grape it will be 800$

## Objective values of Strawberry, Orange
```{r}
sol2$solution
```
# The amount of each type of soda here we have: 12 of Strawberry,
28 of Orange

## Visualize Amount of each type of soda without Grape
```{r}
barplot(sol2$solution,
     main ="Amount of each type of Soda",
     names.arg = c("Strawberry", "Orange"),
     col = "blue",
     density = 20
     )
```

## Final Results
As we see here total profit with Grape just 953.5$ and take 20 hours per pack,
without Grape total profit 800$, so Grape takes more time and profits less than
expected.
